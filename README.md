Description
===========

Installs the "emacs" package to install the world's most flexible, customizable text editor.

Requirements
============

## Platform

* Debian/Ubuntu
* Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific/Fedora/Arch
* FreeBSD

Should work on any platform that has a default provider for the `package` resource and a package named `emacs` available in the default package manager repository.

On FreeBSD, Chef version 0.10.6 is required for fixes to the ports package provider.

Attributes
==========

* `node['emacs']['install24']` - Whether to use an upstream provider for Emacs 24, currently Ubuntu-only. Defaults to `false`.
* `node['emacs']['packages']` - An array of Emacs package names to install. Defaults to the "No X11" name based on platform and falls back to "emacs".

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Installs the emacs package and any ELPA packages in the list `node['emacs']['elpa']`.

Usage
=====

Simply add `recipe[emacs]` to the run list of a base role that gets applied to all systems. Modify the `node['emacs']['packages']` attribute if the default package name for your platform is unavailable or incorrect (see `attributes/default.rb`). You should modify this with an attribute in a role applied to the node. For example:

    name "base"
    description "base role is applied to all nodes"
    run_list("recipe[emacs]")
    default_attributes(
      "emacs" => {
        "packages" => ["emacs-nox"]
      }
    )

As this is an array you can append other emacs-related packages, such as to make configuration modes available.

Managing ELPA Packages
----------------------

This LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional [ELPA](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) packages. Requires that `node['emacs']['install24']` be set to `true`.

# Actions

- :add: installs the ELPA package
- :remove: removes the ELPA package

# Attribute Parameters

- package: name attribute. The name of the package to install
- archive: URL to download packages from if package is not part of [ELPA](http://elpa.gnu.org), [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org) or [Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive](http://melpa.milkbox.net) which are loaded by default.
- user: the user to install packages for
- directory: where to install the packages, default is `/root/.emacs.d/elpa` for `root` or `/home/USER/.emacs/elpa` for the `user` specified by the attribute

# Examples

```ruby
#coffee-mode
emacs_elpa "coffee-mode"
```

```ruby
emacs_elpa "ac-helm"
```

```ruby
#remove coffee-mode
emacs_elpa "nostinkingcoffee" do
  package "coffee-mode"
  action :remove
end
```
