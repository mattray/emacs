Description
===========

Installs the "emacs" package to install the worlds most flexible, customizable text editor.

Requirements
============

## Platform

* Debian/Ubuntu
* Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific/Fedora/Arch
* FreeBSD

Should work on any platform that has a default provider for the `package` resource and a package named `emacs` avaialble in the default package manager repository.

On FreeBSD, Chef version 0.10.6 is required for fixes to the ports package provider.

Attributes
==========

* `node['emacs']['24']` - Whether to use an upstream provider for Emacs 24, currently Ubuntu-only. Defaults to `false`.
* `node['emacs']['packages']` - An array of Emacs package names to install. Defaults to the "No X11" name based on platform and falls back to "emacs".

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Installs the emacs package.

Usage
=====

Simply add `recipe[emacs]` to the run list of a base role that gets applied to all systems. Modify the `node['emacs']['packages']` attribute if the default package name for your platform is unavailable or incorrect (see `attributes/default.rb`). You should modify this with an attribute in a role applied to the node. For example:

    name "base"
    description "base role is applied to all nodes"
    run_list("recipe[emacs]")
    default_attributes(
      "emacs" => {
        "packages" => ["emacs-nox"]
      }
    )

As this is an array you can append other emacs-related packages, such as to make configuration modes available.
